# biogrowth

This R package includes several functions for modelling microbial growth based on predictive microbiology.

It includes functions for making prediction and model fitting under static and dynamic conditions, as well as for estimating the values of cardinal parameters from existing growth rates.

It can also be used to make stochastic predictions of microbial growth.
