\item{line_col}{Aesthetic parameter to change the colour of the line geom in the plot, see: \code{\link{geom_line}}}

\item{line_size}{Aesthetic parameter to change the thickness of the line geom in the plot, see: \code{\link{geom_line}}}

\item{line_type}{Aesthetic parameter to change the type of the line geom in the plot, takes numbers (1-6) or strings ("solid") see: \code{\link{geom_line}}}

\item{ribbon80_fill}{fill colour for the space between the 10th and 90th quantile, see: \code{\link{geom_ribbon}}}
